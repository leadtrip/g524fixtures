You can define an object template to define some common properties that will be replicated in all object instances
based on that template.

Consider the following GORM domain class:
[,groovy]
----
class Flight {
  String departure
  String arrival
  double price
}
----

You define the template adding a closure that marks the object as an abstract bean (Warsaw - Szczecin flight in this
example):
[,groovy]
----
wawSzzFlight(Flight, departure: "WAW", arrival: "SZZ") { it.abstract = true }
----

Then you create concrete objects referencing the template through a closure that tells that the object definition
should be based on the template:
[,groovy]
----
wawSzzCheapFlight(Flight, price: 10.0) { it.parent = wawSzzFlight }
wawSzzExpensiveFlight(Flight, price: 300.0) { it.parent = wawSzzFlight }
// departure == "WAW" and arrival == "SZZ" of both cheap and expensive flights.
----

Note that you cannot reference the template object in your tests - a `BeanIsAbstractException` will be raised.
