Sometimes it's necessary to do something before or after your fixture is loaded. You can do this by adding `pre` and/or `post` handler in your fixture files.

[,groovy]
----
pre {
  /* do things before loading fixture */
}

fixture {
  /* fixture definition */
}

post {
  /* do things after loading fixture */
}
----

All beans in your application (and any parent fixtures, see [stacking|guide:stacking]) are available in both pre and post processors...

[,groovy]
----
pre {
  someService.someMethod()
}
----

Additionally, any object loaded in the fixture is available in the _post_ processor by name...

[,groovy]
----
fixture {
  log(LogMessage) {
    message = "something happened"
  }
}
post {
  // change the creation date of the log message
  log.dateCreated -= 1
  log.save()
}
----

Pre process handlers are executed as soon as they are encountered. However, post processors are *not* executed until all fixtures have been loaded (e.g. load patterns that match multiple files or fixtures with includes).
