Fixture files can load other fixture files as _parents_ via the `load()` method that takes one or more file patterns like the `fixtureLoader.load()` method.

[,groovy]
----
load "authors"

fixture {
  gina(Book, title: "Groovy In Action", authors: [guillaume, dierk])
}
----

This will cause the `authors` fixtures file to be _executed_ and _loaded_\, with it then being the parent of the fixture defined in the file. In other words, the objects in the _inner_ fixture (`authors` in this example) are instantiated and saved at the point where the `load()` call occurs.

The `load()` method in a fixture file can also define a fixture inline, which has the same effect.

[,groovy]
----
load {
  guillaume(Author, name: "Guillaume Laforge")
  dierk(Author, name: "Dierk Koenig")
}

fixture {
  gina(Book, title: "Groovy In Action", authors: [guillaume, dierk])
}
----
