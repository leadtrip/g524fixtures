Fixture files can include other fixture files via the `include()` method that takes one or more file patterns like the `fixtureLoader.load()` method.

[,groovy]
----
include "authors"

fixture {
  gina(Book, title: "Groovy In Action", authors: [guillaume, dierk])
}
----

This will cause the `authors` fixtures file to be _executed_ and _merged_ into the current fixture.
